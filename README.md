# Bunz Sponsored Survey Mockups

Create instant mockups of sponsored surveys.

## Access
Hosted at https://alisa-lin.github.io/bunz-mockups.

## Usage
Fill in all fields. To erase the default text/assets, you must enter something into the corresponding input field. For example, to have a promo card without a promo code, you must enter a space into the promo code text box to remove the default "BUNZ" promo code.

Upon reload, all assets will reset to the default Boozer sponsored survey.

## Limitations
* This will only work if the survey question is two lines and the survey answers are one line each
* There is no option to disable a promo card
* If the promo card runs off screen, it will run off screen. The text will resize but the screen will not extend to accomodate the lengthened promo card
* If the BTZ amount is not two digits, the "Earn X BTZ" UI will look strange

## Future Improvements
* Replace certain images such as the survey card with `border-radius: 12px` rectangles to allow for dynamic resizing
* Allow dynamic resizing of the survey card to accomodate survey question length and survey question length. Push down the promo card to accomodate the dynamically sized survey card
* Find a way to implement an extended promo card that works. This will be easier if Eythan redesigns the background of the survey (currently it is a static image, which makes it difficult to implement). If the survey is not redesigned, consider implementing a scrolling effect
* Allow the ability to disable the promo card (ie have no promo card)
